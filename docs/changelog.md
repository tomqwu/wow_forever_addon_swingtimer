## 0.3.0

- Shows a live decimal yard reading when the client provides a validated numeric target distance.
- Updates the displayed number every 0.15 seconds while a living target is selected, including friendly targets when supported.
- Retains spell-based brackets whenever numeric distance is unavailable; never invents an exact number or keeps a stale reading.
- Keeps attack-range colors independent of numeric distance, which can differ from combat reach.

Use `/reload`. Exact numeric readings are not guaranteed for enemy targets or restricted areas; `/futils status` reports availability.

## 0.2.1

- Fixed an out-of-range result remaining blue when Auto Shot metadata was unavailable and other spells supplied a bounded distance estimate.
- A confirmed negative ranged-attack check now shows red “Out of range,” even when too close versus too far cannot be determined.
- Added regression checks for the actual red icon border and accent colors.

Use `/reload`, then `/futils status` to confirm v0.2.1. Blue still means a distance bracket is known but no attack-range result is available.

## 0.2.0

- The indicator dims to 20% opacity when no target is selected.
- Selecting a target restores full visibility immediately; unlocking keeps the indicator visible for positioning.
- Out-of-range results remain red, with readable text on a dark panel.
- GitHub release notes and CurseForge build descriptions now include the maintained feature overview and version-specific changes.

Update with `/reload`. Your saved position and scale are preserved.
